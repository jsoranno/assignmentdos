Enthusiastic and well-organized with solid background in data analytics, schedule management and event planning. Energetic self-starter with excellent technical, organizational, and creative skills.</p>

           	people doing real things. Coming from a varied and diverse background, I'm able 	
           	contribute something unique. Currently working on manifesting my ideas.
